# Design Principles - Quick Notes

## Inheritance Approach
- Enables designing the application, but has limitations when introducing new behaviors.
- Any changes in the parent class require updates in all subclasses, increasing maintenance effort.

## Interfaces Approach (Flyable & Quackable)
- Prevents unwanted inherited behaviors and allows selective behavior implementation.
- It completely destroys code reuse for those behaviors, which can lead to maintenance challenges.
- And ofcourse there might be more than one kind of flying behavior even among the ducks that do fly.
